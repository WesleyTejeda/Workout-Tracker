## Demo

## Description
In this repository I've created a site that tracks the information of your workout. Simply create a new workout and add all your exercises. When you reach your last exercise for the day, hit complete on the last entry and the app will route you back to the index page and show your your workout results. You can also click on the dashboard button on the top left of the screen which will route you to a stats page with charts based on your last 7 workouts.

## Installation
Install using ```npm install```
Dependancies used: Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Morgan, Seed, & DotEnv
## Usage
After installations, if you wish to run this locally, the database will be created for you when you run the program using ```node server.js```.
